## My process

### Built with

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript

### What I learned

Attempted to use BEM for CSS naming. I want to continue trying BEM and maybe another naming convention to further organize my code.

### Continued development

May look into restructuring the general HTML, it turned out messier than I originally planned on.

### Useful resources

- [BEM](https://getbem.com/introduction/) - Introduction and information about BEM methodology.
